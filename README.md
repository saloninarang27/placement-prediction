 I have made the project Campus Placement Prediction. In this 
project of placement prediction, we have used some data from Kaggle in which using the 
various factors we have concluded whether the student got placed or not. So, on the behalf of 
factors like entrance test marks, college percentage, previous experiences… we have predicted 
that whether the student will get placements or not and with total probability percentage. In 
this project we have used various algorithms like logistic regression, support vector machine, 
k nearest neighbour, decision tree classifier, random forest etc… where logistics regression has 
provided us the best result with around an average of 90% accurate.
